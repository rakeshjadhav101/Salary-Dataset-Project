**I took this project from the study case assignment Mini Course Data Analytics.**

**This Salary Dataset Project uses various tools, namely :**

* Python with Google Colab to view data and perform data cleaning before data is used,
Google BigQuery to create queries from datasets so that they are ready for further visualization, and
GDS or Google Data Studio to perform Data Visualization.
The following is a description of the file used :

* The original dataset is on salary_dataset.csv file.
* Cleaning data using python as in the datacleaning_salary.py file.
* Same as using python regarding the data exploration steps, only the file extension is different, where the file datacleaning_salary.ipynb can be used for Jupyter Notebook.
* The dataset that has been done Data Cleaning is in the salary-dataset.csv file.
* SQL query file that will be used for data visualization is contained in the query.sql file.
* The file with the Power Point extension (ASSIGNMENT4.pptx) contains the steps and the results of the work that has been done.
* The file with the Portable Document Format (PDF) extension (ASSIGNMENT4.pdf) contains the steps and the results of the work same as the PPT file, that has been done.
* The steps for Data Cleaning are as follows :
